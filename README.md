Common Questions About How to
Grow Instagram Followers
Wondering how to gain Instagram followers who will stick around for
the long-haul? Hereâ€™s the down low on a few of the most frequently
asked questions we receive.
Is it important to focus on follower count?
Instagram followers can make a big impact! As you grow your account,
you can boost your organic reach, allowing you to connect with more
people and share your message far and wide. But that doesnâ€™t mean
that numbers are everything.
Buying fake Instagram followers is never the solution. In fact, fake
followers tend to bog down social media accounts, making it harder to
reach real people. When in doubt, remember that an authentic,
engaged social audience is more important than vanity metrics. Quality
over quantity!
How often should I post on Instagram?
Whether you regularly share Instagram posts, Reels or prefer
Instagram stories, youâ€™re probably wondering how often you should be
sharing something new. The truth is that it really depends on your
account and goals.
What matters most is posting consistency. You need to find a posting
frequency that works well for your brand and your audience, all while
being easy to maintain over time. Once you have a plan in place, stick
to it for the best results.
